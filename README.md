The Yellow Dapp is a comprehensive blockchain-based system that is capable of managing the entire economic life cycle of film production.

The proposed film and business model include reserved slots for crypto community exposure. In the docuseries episodes, those crypto communities play a key role in the use case of CBK tokens by booking those slots through the Dapp.


The Yellow Dapp establishes a collaborative and inclusive environment where different parts of the ecosystem meet around this Ethereum token. It substitutes Fiat payments using the Film2market.sol solidity functions.


Crypto communities seeking to be part of the content can use Film2market.sol to buy/redeem CBK tokens. Community initiatives in this system can expect a top tier exposure while contributing to the main general purpose of divulgation.


The Yellow Dapp is a â€œPartially upgradable'' open-source Ethereum Smart Contract serving as a payment system itself while managing the liquidity strategy and setting the film financial workflow. Calculations are intended to secure holders' dependency on volume, price, and liquidity.


This Smart Contract creates an On-Chain version of a Buy&Redeem system. The customer autonomously interacts with the proposed contract with no middle-men.
