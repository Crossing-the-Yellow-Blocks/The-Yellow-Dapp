The Yellow Dapp
Getting Started
The Yellow dAPP is a decentralized platform that facilitates the funding and management of audiovisual projects. After tokenizing each frame and millisecond in digital content and converting it into actual virtual assets, token holders will contribute to the proposed community-driven platform and generate additional value to Blockchain projects. 
 
Prerequisites
-Non-custodial wallet: recommend Metamask or wallet connect.
-A compatible internet browser.
-Project tokens amount (of the whitelisted project) in your wallet address.

  How to use the Dapp
Once you have the above ready, open the following link (.....), which directs you to the Yellow dAPP. You select the project in question, which if it reaches the established amount, will be exchanged for time exposure in a top tier VOD in exchange for your contribution in project tokens. If the marked amount is reached, the redeemed will be activated by exchanging the project tokens for CBK, and these CBKs for time exposure in a top-tier platform.
 
Built With
Solidity- To deploy the dAPP smart-contract
Web3- To connect the frontend to the Blockchain
Contributing
To contribute to the dAPP it is necessary to have whitelisted the project token in question. Anyone can request the token whitelist by completing this google form. Finally, the team studies the proposed projects and the selected will have a smart contract where the community will participate to reach the estimated amount to get this exposure time on the Crossing the Yellow Blocks docuseries.
